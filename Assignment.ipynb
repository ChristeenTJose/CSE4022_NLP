            "I like a bit of pow-wow in any place. Let me rephrase before you think I am eternally hankering for a fight. What I mean is I would choose crooked streets over straight highways, sweaty mayhem over pristine elegance. This is why no matter where I go in this world, coming home to India, and especially Bombay, is never dull. I blame growing up in the city for my pugilistic predilections. One of the many descriptors that Mark Twain used in relation to Bombay was “pow-wow.” The place seemed to confound him: “Bewitching”, “Bewildering”, “Enchanting”, “Arabian Nights come again?”—the man was repulsed and riveted at the same time. It was a place befitting the number of exclamations he used. At 13, I was yet to be permitted the pleasures of travelling unchaperoned outside Bombay but within its confines, I had free rein to indulge my inner flâneur. I became the weekend loafer, slacking through parts of the city I really had no business being in. My itinerary hardly ever changed: Take the BEST bus to Chowpatty; after filling up on chaat, sample some more at the khau gully in Churchgate; sometimes, pretend to shop for music I could not afford at Kala Ghoda’s Rhythm House, where the desperately-trying-to-be-hip hung out in the 1990s. The final stretch was always my favourite: trudging along to my personal Shangri-La, Victoria Terminus. At VT, I parsed the sea of faces. I drummed up mind games to fill time like “Who’s new and who isn’t?” Spotting either was fairly simple. The former bunch bears dazed glances and open mouths. A person gyrating through the mob with minimum physical contact had been practising for the Local Train Olympics for a few years at least. When it was my turn to head back to the suburbs, I warmed up, adopted a stance that would make Usain Bolt proud and dashed off like the Flash into an incoming train. Like millions of others, Bombay taught me independent travel, in the crudest sense of the term. And it prepared me for the swirling madness that lies in the rest of India. In August, we are showcasing and extolling the allure of domestic journeys. Hampi, celebrated for its ruins, reveals something unexpected after every visit. In Hyderabad, we feature Sufi shrines, some of which abound in nooks you wouldn’t notice. Banaras’s cosy classical music cafés leave a lasting impression on a newcomer’s heart, and in West Bengal, a heritage renaissance seems to be afoot in Serampore.

            "For my money, memorable disagreements often centre on food. A friend who was about to settle abroad was feeling particularly wistful about a storied south Bombay restaurant, the kind of eatery that locals like to call “overrated” and guidebook-toting tourists faithfully make a beeline for. His favourite on the menu? The baklava—a dry fruit-laden traditional sweet that smacked of decadence in every bite. The first time he requested for the dessert at the restaurant, its eccentric owner was not impressed. Sizing up his credentials, he asked, “Have you had baklava before?” “Yes.” “Where?” “In Turkey.” Suspicions confirmed, the gentleman chided him. “Arre baba, that is the Turkish baklava. This is the Iranian one…” What followed was a 10-minute tutorial on the precise ways in which they differed, part-comical and part-endearing. Forget the grand battles for identity being waged around the world, food drives everyday culture wars. They are infinitely more interesting and the only injury caused is to one’s pride—we could all use some schooling on that front. Besides, unlike spikier tiffs, these usually end in smiles and a knowing wink. Last year I was perusing dinner options at Le Goutillon, an unpretentious French bistro in the heart of Chantilly. After four days in the country, most of my companions were satisfied with their fill of meat and wine, and chose conservatively. However, I and another compatriot were feeling emboldened (perhaps, it was the glass of red) and scanned the chalkboard menu for more adventurous fare. “Bring us the steak!” we declared. When our substantial cuts of beef arrived, it was soon revealed that we had held our appetite in unwarranted esteem. At the end of that meal, Goutillon’s server—a stern, no-nonsense woman—took an eyebrow-cocked look at our barely empty dishes and shook her head in disapproval. A local hotel manager later reminded us of our misplaced bravado. “Oh yeah, I heard about the Indians who didn’t finish their steak!” he giggled. France 2; India 0. In this time’s food special though, India’s showing is strong. Bombay Canteen’s Chef Thomas Zacharias, a flagbearer for all things desi, picks his top 10 must-haves from across the country. A devout traveller, he dishes on where you can seek out the finest haleem and unforgettable curries. We explore subcultures in Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai through three different food walks. Writer Reema Islam pens a heartfelt ode to dolmades, the Grecian staple that is intertwined with her own history of growing up in Libya and Bangladesh. Antoine Lewis gathers a list of kitchen maestros, from Alex Atala to a reclusive monk in South Korea, each of whom are worth a pilgrimage. Ardent gourmands might also want to consider Dubrovnik, which in writer David Farley’s words, is Europe’s emerging food capital.

Upper-class travel doesn’t deserve this slight. As more astute aesthetes have reminded us in the past, refined tastes don’t have to be gauche.

There’s pride that National Geographic Traveller India has lived to see another day, and in today’s precarious media landscape, that should account for something. Then the gnawing question: did we get it right? When it comes to travel, is there a right or a wrong way to do it? Early this month, The New York Times unearthed Albert Einstein’s entries of his journeys around Asia and discovered a surprising side to the Nobel Prize winner. About his time in mainland China he wrote, “In the air there is a stench of never-ending manifold variety.” The people, he found, were “industrious, filthy, obtuse…” Travel often functions as a Rorschach test of biases. Some are acutely aware of this and spend their time making amends. Anthony Bourdain’s recent passing prompted glowing tributes from around the world to his open-minded exploration of parts and cultures unknown. There are others who stand their ground: If a traveller’s true sentiments veer towards exotification, maybe it should stay so. Read Indian-American author Akhil Sharma’s recounting of a fortnight in Japan, featured in this issue, for a perfect example.

To which, casual travellers will respond with, “I will take my comfortable stay in a nice hotel, thank you very much.” NGTI’s sixth anniversary is a distillation of these myriad attitudes to travel. In their own way, our writers show you the “right way to do it.” Our centrepiece is the “Smart Hacks” section that features an expert’s take on how best to navigate a place.
